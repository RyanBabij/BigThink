Chess engine framework to test AI development. I play a bit of chess but I'm not high-level or anything, so I think it would be interesting to see if I can make a chess engine which can beat me, and maybe even teach me how to play better. I want to start out with a basic engine which uses heuristics and minmax trees, and later on I would like to try and implement a nerual net which can find patterns in good positions.
